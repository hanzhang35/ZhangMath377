    "## 1. Dungeons and Dragons and Sampling\n",
    "In the game Dungeons & Dragons, each player plays the role of a fantasy character.\n",
    "\n",
    "A player performs actions by rolling a 20-sided die, adding a \"modifier\" number to the roll, and comparing the total to a threshold for success.  The modifier depends on her character's competence in performing the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose Alice's character, a barbarian warrior named Roga, is trying to knock down a heavy door.  She rolls a 20-sided die, adds a modifier of 11 to the result (because her character is good at knocking down doors), and succeeds if the total is greater than 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Question 1.1 ** <br/>Write code that simulates that procedure.  Compute three values: the result of Alice's roll (`roll_result`), the result of her roll plus Roga's modifier (`modified_result`), and a boolean value indicating whether the action succeeded (`action_succeeded`).  **Do not fill in any of the results manually**; the entire simulation should happen in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* A roll of a 20-sided die is a number chosen uniformly from the array `make_array(1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 20)`.  So a roll of a 20-sided die *plus 11* is a number chosen uniformly from that array, plus 11."

For 492 players, it's not so unreasonable to expect to see all the data, but usually we aren't so lucky.  Instead, we often make *statistical inferences* about a large underlying population using a smaller sample.\n",

    "A statistical inference is a statement about some statistic of the underlying population, such as \"the average salary of NBA players in 2014 was $3\".  You may have heard the word \"inference\" used in other contexts.  It's important to keep in mind that statistical inferences, unlike, say, logical inferences, can be wrong.\n",

This strategy sometimes works well and sometimes doesn't.  The degree to which it gives us useful answers depends on several factors, and we'll touch lightly on a few of those today.\n",
